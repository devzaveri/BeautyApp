# BeautyApp

Welcome to the BeautyApp repository! This is a demo application created to showcase my knowledge and skills in React Native, Redux, Navigation, and other essential tools and techniques used in mobile app development.

The app begins with a comprehensive authentication flow that includes:
- <b>Login Screen:</b> Users can log in using their credentials.
- <b>Sign Up Screen:</b> New users can create an account.
- <b>Forgot Password:</b> Screen: Users can recover their password.

For the authentication flow, I utilized the <b>fbemitter</b> library to efficiently switch between the authentication stack and the main application stack. This ensures a smooth transition from the login phase to the main app experience.

After successful authentication, users are navigated to the Home Page. Hereâ€™s what you can expect:
- <b>Home Page:</b> Displays a list of items available. Users can click on any item to navigate to the Item Details screen for more information.
- <b>Favorites:</b> Users can mark items as favorites. These favorites are managed using Redux, allowing the favorites list to persist across sessions. The favorites list can be viewed in the Favorites Screen.
